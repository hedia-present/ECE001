<h1>Smart City</h1>
<pre><h3>By now , we must have heard about the term Smart City. The hypothesis of the 
optimized traffic system I mentioned earlier, is one of the many aspects that 
constitute a smart city.
The thing about the smart city concept is that itâ€™s very specific to a city. The 
problems faced in Mumbai are very different than those in Delhi. The problems in Hong 
Kong are different from New York. Even global issues, like finite clean drinking 
water, deteriorating air quality and increasing urban density, occur in different 
intensities across cities. Hence, they affect each city differently.
The Government and engineers can use IoT to analyze the often-complex factors of town 
planning specific to each city. The use of IoT applications can aid in areas like 
water management, waste control, and emergencies.</h3></pre>
