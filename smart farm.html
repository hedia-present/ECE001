<h1>Smart Farm</h1>
<pre><h3>Statistics estimate the ever-growing world population to reach nearly 10 
billion by the year 2050. To feed such a massive population one needs to marry 
agriculture to technology and obtain best results. There are numerous possibilities 
in this field. One of them is the Smart Greenhouse.
A greenhouse farming technique enhances the yield of crops by controlling 
environmental parameters. However, manual handling results in production loss, energy 
loss, and labor cost, making the process less effective.
A greenhouse with embedded devices not only makes it easier to be monitored but also, 
enables us to control the climate inside it. Sensors measure different parameters 
according to the plant requirement and send it to the cloud. It, then, processes the 
data and applies a control action..</h3></pre>
