     <h1>what is internet of things ?</h1>
<pre><h3>is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital 
machines provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer 
data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer 
interaction.

The definition of the Internet of things has evolved due to the convergence of 
multiple technologies, real-time analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and 
embedded systems.
Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, 
automation (including home and building automation), and others all contribute to 
enabling the Internet of things. In the consumer market, IoT technology is most 
synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the "smart home", covering 
devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems 
and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, 
and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones 
and smart speakers.
There are a number of serious concerns about dangers in the growth of IoT, especially 
in the areas of privacy and security, and consequently industry and governmental 
moves to address these concerns have begun. </h3></pre>
