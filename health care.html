<h1>Health Care</h1>
<pre><h3>IoT applications can turn reactive medical-based systems into proactive 
wellness-based systems.
The resources that current medical research uses, lack critical real-world 
information. It mostly uses leftover data, controlled environments, and volunteers 
for medical examination. IoT opens ways to a sea of valuable data through analysis, 
real-time field data, and testing. 
The Internet of Things also improves the current devices in power, precision, and 
availability. IoT focuses on creating systems rather than just equipment.</h3></pre>
